        We are excited to announce that Maine Feldenkrais & Physical Therapy has joined the Back in Motion Physical Therapy family. This partnership will allow us to expand our services and better serve our community. <br/><br/>

The physical therapists at Back in Motion Physical Therapy have advanced training in a variety of areas, so we can help you with even the most complex musculoskeletal injuries. Whether youâ€™re getting back to work, playing sports, or simply trying to complete everyday activities, we can help you reach your full potential. <br/><br/>

For our existing patients, nothing will change. You will still be able to visit the same clinic and work with the same physical therapists. <br/><br/>

We are very grateful for your trust and support, and we look forward to continuing to serve you as part of the Back in Motion Physical Therapy family.
